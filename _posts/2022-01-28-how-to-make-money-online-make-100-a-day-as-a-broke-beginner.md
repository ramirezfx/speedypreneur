“In this tutorial I show you how to make money online using Google maps. To have a website rank high in Google people need to have a secure website, most people don’t.

It’s important that they implement SSL and we can do this for them. The first thing you want to do is head over to Google and find a list of the most popular local businesses.

Once you have found some start putting them into Google, we will start the making money part soon. Now that you have their websites up start checking them to make sure they are secure websites, if they are not then these are the ones you want to save.

Now that you have a list of websites without SSL you can contact them and offer to fix it for them, this is how you make money online with this tutorial.

You can fix this yourself or you can use a website called Fiverr to find someone to fix it for you. You can charge a bit of money for this, if you charged $400 you would only need to do two a week to make good money online.”
