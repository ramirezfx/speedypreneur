_“If you struggle to figure out what to say in your articles then this video is for you._

_If you write a sentence, erase it, then start another one, and erase that one too because it’s just not quite right…then watch this video and I’ll show you how to write good content fast using one of my favorite content patterns…the what? why? how? structure._

_Here’s what’s in this video:_

_1. We start with a touch of review from our previous lessons so you remember what you’ve learned so far._

_2. next we dig into the basic structure of the what, why, how content pattern and I show you how it will make your life as an article writer 10X easier._

_3. We then move into each piece of the content pattern. I show you step-by-step what goes into this type of article, where it goes on the page, and describe the actual content for each section._

_4. In the “why” section we talk about why your content matters, and why it matters for your audience. I also explain some of the theory behind the approach._

_5. Finally we get into the “how” part of your article and I show you how to conclude your piece in a way that delivers big value to your readers._

_Lastly, I share an opportunity for those who want to get their first published article on a real media outlet to help you build credibility and add a portfolio piece that you can show to clients._

_By the end of this video you’ll be ready to craft a What? Why? How? article and put it out in the world for yourself, for media outlets, or for clients!”_
